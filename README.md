Share To Email Android app

Ever been in a hurry when you didn't have the time to read an interesting webpage on you phone but didn't want to add it to your TODO list? I think you've just sent it to yourself by email just like I do it most of time. This app will make this process faster! Just add some email addresses (maybe set one of them as default so the app won't ask you) and share the link from your browser to ShareToEmail. It will the automatically fill up the necessary fields in the mail client and you just have to press the send button!
